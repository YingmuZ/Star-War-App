"StarWarFilms" is a single page application designed for presenting all the Star War films and their detailed information by requesting data from Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/). It was embedded with a black and starry visual design. You can easily run it by cloning this repo, installing the needed modules and typing "npm start" :)
