"StarWarFilms" is a single page application designed for presenting all the Star War films and their detailed information by requesting data from Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/). 
It is developed by React Hooks features (useState, useEffect, useCallback), also using asynchronous JavaScript (Callbacks, Promises, Async Await). For the vidual perspective, it is embedded with a black and starry visual design. 
You can easily run it by cloning this repo, installing the needed modules and typing "npm start" :)
